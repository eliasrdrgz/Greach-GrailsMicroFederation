Please read these instructions before starting the lab work in the Greach workshop.

Requirements:

You will need JDK 8 and Git for this workshop.

Notes:

This workshop project is structured as a multi-module project, with each module representing an individual microservice in the federation.

Two of the services are implemented in Grails 3.x. Three of the services are simple Spring Cloud services providing cross-cutting support
services to the federation. A "real" application would include many more business services, redundant discovery services, etc., but
this small federation is a foundation you can use to start building your own microservice federation.

The master branch represents the working solution. The workshop branch is the branch you will do your lab work work against. The directions
will specify the particular project and artifact to modify. If you get stuck, just compare the artifact being modified in the workshop
branch with the one in master.
